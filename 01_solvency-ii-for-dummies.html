<p>When you become an <b>actuary</b>, you hear the term “Solvency II” a lot. What is Solvency II? Let’s summarize the basics.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Solvency II</h2>

  <ul>
  	<li><strong>Solvency</strong> - the "Solvency" in "Solvency II" emphasises that the focus of this regime is to keep the insurance companies solvent. The regime requires that each insurance company has enough money to pay its policyholders, even in the worse years.</li>
  	<li><strong>II</strong> - the "II" in "Solvency II" means that it’s the sequel! There has already been “Solvency I” in the past that differ in a few aspects. Solvency II came into effect back in 2016.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Regime</h2>

  <p>Solvency II is a <strong>reporting regime</strong>. Regime sounds quite scary, huh?</p>

  <p>In the actuarial context, we can think of a regime as a set of rules. The rules state what components actuaries should calculate. They also determine how they should calculate them. The rules might, for example, concern what discounting rates to use or what shocks to apply to determine the capital requirement.</p>

  <p>Who has set all these rules? The Solvency II Directive has been published by the European Union.</p>

  <p>We can also say that Solvency II is a <strong>framework</strong> which can be understood as a structure underlying a system.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>

  <p>The key objectives of Solvency II are:</p>

  <ul>
  	<li>to increase the level of harmonisation of solvency regulation across Europe,</li>
  	<li>to protect policyholders,</li>
  	<li>to introduce Europe-wide capital requirements,</li>
  	<li>to provide appropriate incentives for good risk management.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Solvency II also aims to allow for comparability of the balance sheets of insurance companies. As a regime, it requires its own risk assessment as well as market discipline.</p>

  <h2>Legal documents</h2>

  <p>Two legal documents describe the rules of Solvency II.</p>

  These are:
  <ul>
  	<li><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0138" target="_blank">Directive</a> - Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25  November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II),</li>
  	<li><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R0035" target="_blank">Deletegated Regulation</a> - Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All members of the European Union must follow these regulations. It means that all European companies report in the same way. Thanks to that, it is easier to compare results between different companies.</p>

  <h2>Balance Sheet</h2>

  <p>Liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet consist of three components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Best Estimate Liabilities,</li>
    <li>Risk Margin,</li>
    <li>Solvency Capital Requirement.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Disclosures</h2>

  <p>Solvency II is based on three Pillars. Pillar 3 concerns Reporting, disclosure and market discipline.</p>

  <p>Pillar 3 requires so that each insurance company:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>provides the regulator with Regular Supervisory Report (RSR),</li>
  	<li>completes Quantitative Reporting Templates (QRT) - they need to be completed fully once a year and partly every quarter,</li>
  	<li>issues to the public Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b><abbr title="Regular Supervisory Report">RSR</abbr></b> should contain:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>results of the solvency calculations performed under Pillar 1,</li>
  	<li>results of Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) performed under Pillar 2,</li>
  	<li>details of the risk management processes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In <b><abbr title="Quantitative Reporting Templates">QRTs</abbr></b>, the quantitative information is disclosed in a prescribed format.</p>

  <p><b><abbr title="Solvency and Financial Condition Report">SFCR</abbr></b> contains extracts from <abbr title="Regular Supervisory Report">RSR</abbr> that are not confidential.</p>

  <p>Actuaries might also be obliged to fill National Specific Templates (NST) which are imposed by local regulators. They contain specific requirements of a particular country.</p>
