<p>Best Estimate Liabilities (BEL) is an important component of Technical Provisions in a Solvency II Balance Sheet. A job of an <b>actuary</b> is, among others, to calculate its value.</p>

<p>Liabilities of the <a href="/blog/solvency-ii-balance-sheet" target="_blank">Solvency II Balance Sheet</a> contain Technical Provisions and Solvency Capital Requirement.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Calculation</h2>

  <p><abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> is calculated as the present value of future inflows less the present value of future outflows. Cash flows include premiums, benefits, expenses and charges. Cash flows should allow for decrements and policyholder actions.</p>

  <p>In the case of unit-linked (UL) savings products, <abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> will be split into the unit and non-unit components. Unit component reflects the fund value held by the insurance company. Non-unit component reflects future charges and benefits.</p>

  <h2>Assumptions</h2>

  <p><abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> bases on best estimate assumptions. Assumptions are set as they expect to happen without any prudence margins. The assumptions are set for insurance factors such as mortality, lapses and expenses.</p>

  <p><b>Mortality</b> assumptions are likely to be set as a percentage of published governmental mortality tables. The percentage depends on the experience and it may vary depending on sales channel, sex, smoker/non-smoker status etc. It also depends on the level of underwriting which is likely to be small for <abbr title="Unit-Linked">UL</abbr> products. However, for products with GAO, the requirement might be higher.</p>

  <p><b>Longevity</b> assumptions should allow for future expected improvements.</p>

  <p><b>Lapses</b> depend on the duration. The highest withdrawal rates are expected at the beginning of the policy. The longer the policy lasts, the lower are the expected lapse rates.</p>

  <p>The <b>expenses</b> assumption may be split into regular and one-off expenses. One-off expenses can include costs of projects, such as a new marketing campaign. Expense assumptions should also allow for expense inflation.</p>

  <h2>Discounting</h2>

  <p>Cash flows are discounted using risk-free interest rates for the relevant currency which is published by <abbr title="European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority">EIOPA</abbr>. The curve can be increased by Matching Adjustment (MA) or Volatility Adjustment (VA).</p>

  <p>To be allowed to use <abbr title="Matching Adjustment">MA</abbr>, the company needs to match inflows and outflows. <abbr title="Volatility Adjustment">VA</abbr> is based on the spread of a representative portfolio of assets for the relevant currency.</p>
