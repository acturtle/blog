  <p>In this post, we will build a model for an insurance product with riders.
    The model will be built in Python using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cashflower/" target="_blank">the cashflower package</a>.
    An interesting part of this project will be that we will use two model point sets.

<h2 id="data_format">Data format</h2>

<p>In this post, we will model an insurance product where a policyholder can have multiple coverages.
  For example, the policyholder can be insured against death and illness within the same policy.</p>

<p>In terms of model point data, the easiest approach would be to have additional columns in the main model point set.
  These columns would contain information on the additional coverages.</p>

<p>However, with many coverages, the model point file might grow out of proportion.
  Also, some policyholders can have one coverage and others multiple.
  If the policyholder is insured only against death then the remaining columns would remain empty.</p>

<p>The model point set could look like this.</p>

<div class="code">
<pre><code>print(main.data)

id  age    sex  premium sum_assured_death sum_assured_illness
 1   32   MALE    140.0        100 000.00           30 000.00
 2   48 FEMALE    150.0        120 000.00                 NaN
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A more efficient solution is to store coverage data in the long format in a separate file.
If the policyholder has 2 coverages, then there will be 1 record in the main model point set and 2 in the additional one.
If the policyholder has only 1 coverage, there will be 1 record in both of the files.</p>

<div class="code">
<pre><code>print(main.data)

id  age    sex  premium
 1   32   MALE    140.0
 2   48 FEMALE    150.0

print(coverage.data)

id  sum_assured     type
 1   100 000.00    DEATH
 1    30 000.00  ILLNESS
 2   120 000.00    DEATH
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first policyholder has two coverages (against death and illness) and the second policyholder has one coverage (only against death).</p>


<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>Install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cashflower/">the cashflower package</a>, if you don't have it yet.</p>

<span class="source">terminal</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>pip install cashflower</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Create a new model named <span class="inline-code">riders</span>.</p>

<span class="source">python console</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>from cashflower import create_model

create_model("riders")</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The new folder <span class="inline-code">riders</span> has been created with the initial files structure.</p>

<p>Let's prepare model point sets and assumptions for the model.
  For this model, we will use two model point sets: one for main policy data and the second for coverages.</p>

<span class="source">riders/input.py</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from cashflower import ModelPointSet

main = ModelPointSet(data=pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2],
    "age": [32, 42],
    "sex": ["MALE", "FEMALE"],
    "premium": [140, 150]
}))

coverage = ModelPointSet(data=pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 1, 2],
    "sum_assured": [100_000, 30_000, 120_000],
    "type": ["DEATH", "ILLNESS", "DEATH"],
}))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first policyholder is a 32-year-old male. The insurance company will pay a benefit of €100 000 in case of death and €30 000 in case of illness.
  The second policyholder is a 42-year-old female. She has only coverage for the event of death with a sum assured of €120 000.
  They pay €140 and €150 premiums respectively.
</p>

<p>We will use 3 assumptions for the model: mortality rate, morbidity rate and interest rate.
  For simplicity, we will assume that each of these assumptions is a single value.
  In production models, these assumptions will form a table.
  For mortality and morbidity, the rates depend on age and sex.
  For the interest rate, the value depends on the term.
</p>

<span class="source">riders/model.py</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>DEATH_PROB = 0.003
MORB_PROB = 0.008
INTEREST_RATE = 0.005
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We have all the input data that we need. Let's start modelling!</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

<p>Let's start with modelling survival rate and expected premium.</p>

<span class="source">riders/model.py</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>from cashflower import variable

from input import main, coverage
from settings import settings

@variable()
def survival_rate(t):
    if t == 0:
        return 1 - DEATH_PROB
    return survival_rate(t-1) * (1 - DEATH_PROB)


@variable()
def expected_premium(t):
    if t == 0:
        return 0
    return main.get("premium") * survival_rate(t-1)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we will calculate the expected benefit.</p>

<p>We have multiple records in the coverage file, so we can model this variable as a list.</p>

<span class="source">riders/model.py</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>@variable()
def expected_coverage_benefit(t):
    benefits = []
    for i in range(coverage.model_point_data.shape[0]):
      if t == 0:
          benefits.append(0)
      else:
        sum_assured = coverage.get("sum_assured, i)
        _type = coverage.get("type", i)

        if _type == "DEATH":
            benefits.append(survival_rate(t - 1) * DEATH_PROB * sum_assured)
        elif _type == "ILLNESS":
            benefits.append(survival_rate(t - 1) * DEATH_PROB * sum_assured)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown coverage type {_type}.")
    return benefits
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The output of this variable is a list.</p>
<p>The first policyholder has two coverages, so the list will contain two elements.
  The first element will be the expected benefit in case of death and the second element will be the expected benefit in case of illness.</p>

<p>The second policyholder has only one coverage, so the list will contain only one element.
  We will see it later on in the results.</p>

<p>We use <span class="inline-code">coverage.model_point_data.shape[0]</span> to get the number of records for the given model point.</p>

<p>Knowing the expected benefit for each of the coverages, we can calculate the overall expected benefit.</p>

<span class="source">riders/model.py</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>@variable()
def expected_benefit(t):
    return sum(expected_coverage_benefit(t))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We sum up all the elements of the list.</p>

<p>We can now calculate the present value of expected cash flows and the best estimate of liabilities.</p>

<span class="source">riders/model.py</span>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>@variable()
def pv_expected_premium(t):
    if t == settings["T_MAX_CALCULATION"]:
        return expected_premium(t)
    return expected_premium(t) + pv_expected_premium(t+1) * 1/(1+INTEREST_RATE)


@variable()
def pv_expected_benefit(t):
    if t == settings["T_MAX_CALCULATION"]:
        return expected_benefit(t)
    return expected_benefit(t) + pv_expected_benefit(t+1) * 1/(1+INTEREST_RATE)


@variable()
def best_estimate_liabilities(t):
    return pv_expected_benefit(t) - pv_expected_premium(t)
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>We will produce the individual output, to see clearly how the model evaluated variables for each of the model points.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>there are two sets of results one under another because there are two model points,</li>
  <li><span class="inline-code">expected_coverage_benefit</span> is a list with two elements for the first policyholder and one element for the second policyholder,</li>
  <li>sum of <span class="inline-code">expected_coverage_benefit</span> amounts to <span class="inline-code">expected_benefit</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have dealt with riders by creating a model point set with a long format and using lists are a result of model variables.</p>
