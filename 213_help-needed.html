<p>You may already know cashflower â€” a Python package for cash flow modelling.</p>

<p>cashflower is already working well with example models, but we want to take it further. 
The next big step in its development is testing it with real-world insurance models and their complexities.</p>

<p><strong>This is where we need your help!</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for partner companies willing to support this open-source project.</p>

<p>Here's how the partnership works: we collaborate with your company to test cashflower on real-life models, free of charge. 
In return, you gain access to a cash flow model in Python, with no need for commercial software.</p>

<p>Together, we can identify the package's strengths, address its weaknesses, and help it reach its full potential.</p>

<p>Let's partner to make actuarial modelling even better - for everyone. If your company is interested, let's start the conversation!</p>
