  This book was recommended to me when I started learning about life insurance, and it's often called the "actuarial bible".
  Some chapters were very useful when I was studying for exams, and now that my exams are done, I'm going through the whole book.
  I especially recommend it for learning about survival probabilities, premiums, and reserves — basically all the main concepts.
  My copy of the book was published in 1986.

<h2>"The Theory of Interest" by Stephen G. Kellison</h2>

  This book is really helpful for understanding financial math.
  It's written in a way that starts with simple ideas and then explains more complicated topics.
  It helped me understand interest rates, financial annuities, bonds, and mortgages a lot better.

<h2>"Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava</h2>

<p>
  While it's not specifically an actuarial science book, understanding algorithms can greatly enhance actuarial modeling.  
  I highly recommend <em>Algorithms</em> by Aditya Y. Bhargava — it's one of my favorites!  
  The book breaks down essential algorithms in a clear, approachable way, with plenty of illustrations 
  and examples that make complex concepts easy to grasp.
