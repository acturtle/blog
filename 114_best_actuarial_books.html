  This book was recommended to me when I started learning about life insurance, and it's often called the "actuarial bible".
  Some chapters were very useful when I was studying for exams, and now that my exams are done, I'm going through the whole book.
  I especially recommend it for learning about survival probabilities, premiums, and reserves â€” basically all the main concepts.
  My copy of the book was published in 1986.

  This book is really helpful for understanding financial math.
  It's written in a way that starts with simple ideas and then explains more complicated topics.
  It helped me understand interest rates, financial annuities, bonds, and mortgages a lot better.
