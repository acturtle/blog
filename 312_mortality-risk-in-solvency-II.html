<!-- Intro -->
<section>
    <p>
        In this series of posts, we explore how to calculate the capital requirements 
        that make up the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) under Solvency II regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this specific article, we focus on mortality risk. 
        We'll demonstrate how to build a simple actuarial model for a term life insurance product using Python's cashflower package. 
        Our goal is to calculate and compare liabilities under two scenarios: a base scenario (normal mortality assumptions) 
        and a stressed scenario (increased mortality rates).
    </p>

    <p>
        Mortality stress applies to all insurance products in a company's portfolio that incur losses if mortality rates rise. 
        If certain products, such as annuities, actually benefit from increased mortality, 
        these are excluded from the mortality risk calculations and instead considered under longevity risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the end of this post, you'll clearly understand how mortality risk is assessed according to Solvency II standards, 
        using a practical example.

<!-- Regulation -->
<section>
<h2 id="regulation">1. Regulation</h2>
    <p>According to Article 185 of the Delegated Act of Solvency II:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "The capital requirement for mortality risk shall be equal to the loss in basic own funds 
        that would result from an instantaneous permanent increase of 15% in the mortality rates 
        assumed in the calculation of technical provisions."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In simpler terms, insurers need to calculate how much money they would lose if mortality rates suddenly increased by 15%. 
        This loss determines how much capital they must hold to cover mortality risk.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Input -->
<section>
<h2 id="input">2. Input</h2>

<p>
    To illustrate the calculation clearly, we'll use a straightforward example of a term life insurance product. 
    We detail the inputs step-by-step, including the specific policy data, mortality assumptions, and financial assumptions.
</p>

<h3>2.1 Model points</h3>

<p>In our example, we have three policyholders with the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Policyholder 1: Male, age 45, coverage of €100,000 for 36 months remaining.</li>
    <li>Policyholder 2: Female, age 37, coverage of €150,000 for 60 months remaining.</li>
    <li>Policyholder 3: Male, age 59, coverage of €130,000 for 42 months remaining.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python"># input.py

import pandas as pd
from cashflower import ModelPointSet, Runplan


policy = ModelPointSet(data=pd.DataFrame({
    "sum_assured": [100_000, 150_000, 130_000],
    "remaining_term": [36, 60, 42],
    "sex": ["M", "F", "M"],
    "age": [45, 37, 59]
}))
</code></pre>

<h3>2.2 Mortality data</h3>

<p>
    The mortality data used in this example is sourced from the official European Union data portal 
    (<a href="https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/m5a8zwnf3lbttzlxnt57a" target="_blank">data.europa.eu</a>). 
    Specifically, we've filtered the data for Austria (AT) to use realistic and region-specific mortality rates.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">assumption = dict()
assumption["mortality"] = pd.read_csv("./input/mortality_data.csv")
</code></pre>

<h3>2.3 Other assumptions</h3>

<p>
    For simplicity, we assume a constant monthly interest rate of 0.5%. 
    In real-world models, interest rates typically vary over time, 
    but this simplification helps illustrate the mortality risk calculation clearly.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">assumption["interest_rate"] = 0.005</code></pre>


<h3>2.4 Runplan</h3>

<p>We define two scenarios in our runplan:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Version 1: Base scenario with standard mortality rates.</li>
    <li>Version 2: Stressed scenario where mortality rates are increased by 15% to assess mortality risk.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python">runplan = Runplan(data=pd.DataFrame({
    "version": [1, 2],
    "mortality_stress": [1, 1.15]
}))
</code></pre>
</section>

<!-- Model -->
<section>
<h2 id="model">3. Model</h2>

<p>Below is the actuarial model code and a brief description of each variable used:</p>

<p><b>age(t)</b></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from cashflower import variable

from input import policy, assumption, runplan
from settings import settings


@variable()
def age(t):
    if t == 0:
        return policy.get("age")
    elif t % 12 == 0:
        return age(t-1) + 1
    else:
        return age(t-1)
</code></pre>

<p>Tracks the policyholder's age as it increases each year.</p>

<p><b>mortality_rate(t)</b></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@variable()
def mortality_rate(t):
    df = assumption["mortality"]
    age_t = f"Y{int(age(t))}" if age(t) < 85 else "Y_GE85"
    base_rate = df.loc[(df["sex"] == policy.get("sex")) & (df["age"] == age_t), "OBS_VALUE"].values[0]
    return base_rate * runplan.get("mortality_stress")
</code></pre>

<p>Calculates the probability of death at a given age, adjusted by the mortality stress factor.</p>

<p><b>survival_rate(t)</b></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@variable()
def survival_rate(t):
    if t == 0:
        return 1
    return survival_rate(t-1) * (1 - mortality_rate(t))
</code></pre>

<p>Computes the likelihood that a policyholder survives up to each time period.</p>

<p><b>expected_benefit(t)</b></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@variable()
def expected_benefit(t):
    if t == 0 or t > policy.get("remaining_term"):
        return 0
    return survival_rate(t-1) * mortality_rate(t) * policy.get("sum_assured")
</code></pre>

<p>Estimates the insurance payout expected in each period based on survival and mortality probabilities.</p>

<p><b>liabilities(t)</b></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@variable()
def liabilities(t):
    if t == settings["T_MAX_CALCULATION"]:
        return expected_benefit(t)
    return expected_benefit(t) + liabilities(t+1) * 1/(1+assumption["interest_rate"])
</code></pre>

<p>Calculates the present value of all future expected benefits, accounting for the interest rate.</p>
</section>

<!-- Run and results -->
<section>
    <h2 id="run_and_results">4. Run and results</h2>

    <p>In this section, we run our model using two scenarios and interpret the outcomes.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Base scenario</h3>

    <p>To calculate liabilities under normal conditions (base scenario), run:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">python run.py --version 1</code></pre>

    <p><b>Result:</b> €43,810</p>

    <p>This value represents liabilities calculated using standard mortality assumptions.</p>


    <h3>4.2 Stressed scenario</h3>

    <p>To calculate liabilities with increased mortality (stressed scenario), run:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">python run.py --version 2</code></pre>

    <p><b>Result:</b> €49,493</p>

    <p>Due to the increased mortality rates in this scenario, expected payouts rise, resulting in higher liabilities.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Capital requirement </h3>

    <p>The capital requirement for mortality risk is calculated as the difference in liabilities 
    between the stressed scenario and the base scenario:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>BEL in base scenario: €43,810</li>
        <li>BEL in stressed scenario: €49,493</li>
        <li>Difference: €49,493 - €43,810 = €5,683</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus, the capital requirement due to mortality risk is €5,683.
        This calculated amount is then used as part of the total Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).
    </p>

    <p>This wraps up our practical demonstration of mortality risk calculation under Solvency II standards.</p>
