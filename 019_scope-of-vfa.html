    In life insurance under IFRS 17, there are two main valuation approaches: the General Measurement Model (GMM) and the Variable Fee Approach (VFA). 
    This post focuses on the <strong>Variable Fee Approach</strong> - what it is and when it applies.
  </p>

  <p>The VFA is a modification of the GMM, specifically for direct participating contracts. These contracts must meet certain conditions at inception.</p>

  <p>Only direct participating contracts fall under the VFA in IFRS 17.</p>

  <p>These contracts involve a significant level of <strong>investment-related services</strong>. The policyholder receives an investment return based on underlying items, and the insurer charges a variable fee for these services - hence the name <i>Variable Fee Approach</i>.</p>

  <p>Key characteristics of direct participating contracts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>offer investment-related services,</li>
    <li>share returns on underlying items with policyholders,</li>
    <li>provide the insurer with a variable fee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="criteria">VFA assessment criteria</h2>

  <p>For a contract to qualify for the VFA, it must meet all three conditions outlined in IFRS 17.B101:</p>

  <h3>A. Link to a clearly identified pool of underlying items</h3>

  <blockquote>
    [IFRS 17.B101(a)]<br>
    The contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>There must be an enforceable link between the amounts paid to the policyholder and the underlying items.</p>

  <h3>B. Substantial share of fair value returns</h3>

  <blockquote>
    [IFRS 17.B101(b)]<br> 
    The entity expects to pay the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns 
    on the underlying items.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The insurer must assess the product's fee structure. The smaller the portion of investment returns passed on to the policyholder, the less likely the investment-related services are substantial. This requires judgment based on specific circumstances.</p>

  <h3>C. Policyholder benefits vary with underlying items</h3>

  <blockquote>
    [IFRS 17.B101(c)]<br> 
    The entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder 
    to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This requires evaluating the potential variability of policyholder benefits and their relation to investment returns over the contract's duration. The assessment considers present-value, probability-weighted averages.</p>
  
  <p>If the policyholder has a guaranteed minimum return, the more valuable this guarantee is, the less likely the contract qualifies for the VFA.</p>

  <h2 id="pool">Pool of underlying items</h2>

  <h3>Understanding underlying items</h3>
  <p>VFA contracts are based on underlying items. Let's explain this with an example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract A:</strong> The policyholder's account balance grows at a fixed 2% annual rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract B:</strong> The policyholder's account balance grows based on actual returns from an investment portfolio.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Contract A does not qualify as a VFA contract because there is no link to underlying items. The investment returns are fixed, not tied to actual performance.</p>

  <p>Contract B qualifies as a VFA contract because the returns are linked to an underlying investment portfolio.</p>

  <h3>What are underlying items?</h3>
  <p>
    Underlying items are mostly assets (sometimes liabilities) in which the policyholder participates.
    For example, in unit-linked contracts, policyholders choose from different funds where their premiums are invested. These funds form the <i>pool of underlying items</i>.
    The underlying items must be clearly identified in the contract, though the insurer is not required to hold them.
