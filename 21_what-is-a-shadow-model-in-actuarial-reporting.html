  <p>Do you work in an insurance company? You may come across the term <b>shadow model</b> in the context of actuarial reporting.</p>

  <p>What's hidden in this mysterious term?</p>
</section>


<section>
  <p>Actuarial cash flow models are usually complex. Actuaries develop them in commercial software or with programming languages.</p>

  <p>It's not easy to review these models, especially for actuaries who are less technical. The validators also struggle to audit them due to their complexity.</p>

  <p>That's why it's common to create a shadow cash flow model in <b>an easier environment</b> such as in a spreadsheet. The shadow model replicates the full model results. The shadow model should be <b>as close as possible</b> to the full model's results but remain <b>as simple as possible</b>. Sometimes it's also okay if the shadow model has a minor difference (say up to 1%) if it helps to keep it simple.</p>

  <p>The main aims of the shadow model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>control of the full model's correctness,</li>
    <li>review of the model by other actuaries or validators,</li>
    <li>testing of new functionalities implemented in the model.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <p>The shadow model might only reflect <b>the main functionalities</b> of the full model. That's the case when the full model is complex with plenty of edge cases. For example, the calculation is different for a few policies. If the group of policies is small, then you can omit the functionality.</p>

  <p>Also, the shadow model <b>doesn't have to be fast</b>. The aim of the shadow model is to present functionalities, usually on one policy or on a sample of policies. It's not used for regular reportng so the speed is not very important.</p>
