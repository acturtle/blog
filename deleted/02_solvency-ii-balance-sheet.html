<p>In this post, we will go over components of Solvency II balance sheets.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Components</h2>

  Liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet consist of three elements:
  <ul>
  	<li><a href="/blog/best-estimate-liabilities-in-solvency-ii" target="_blank">BEL</a> - Best Estimate Liabilities,</li>
  	<li><a href="/blog/risk-margin-in-solvency-ii" target="_blank">RM</a> - Risk Margin,</li>
  	<li><a href="/blog/solvency-capital-requirement-in-solvency-ii" target="_blank">SCR</a> - Solvency Capital Requirement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is more difficult for an insurance company to estimate its liabilities than it is for other types of companies. If you sell a policy, you might earn money, but you can also lose money.</p>

  <p>Let’s take as an example a 10-years term life insurance policy.</p>

  <p>The policyholder might or might not die. The insured event might take place at the beginning or at the end of the policy. The policyholder might resign from the policy after a few years.
    Interest rates might change which impact the present value of money.</p>

  <p>A lot of things can happen and they all impact the liability.</p>

  <p>In Solvency II, <abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> reflect the most probable value of liabilities.
    <abbr title="Risk Margin">RM</abbr> additionally reflects the possibility of <abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> differ from the assumed value.
    Whereas <abbr title="Solvency Capital Requirement">SCR</abbr> is for extra security.</p>

  <h2>Best Estimate Liabilities</h2>

  <p>"Best Estimate" part in Best Estimate Liabilities is very important.</p>

  <p>We don’t want to hope for the best and assume that nothing bad (for the company) will happen. So the “happy path” is not an option.<br>
     We don't want to be precocious either and expect that everything will go bad (we will be precocious elsewhere).</p>

  <p><abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> should represent what we expect will actually happen in the future.</p>

  <h2>Risk Margin</h2>

  <p>The next element on the liabilities side is Risk Margin. Risk Margin is the cost of holding capital for non-hedgeable risks.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Best Estimate Liabilities">BEL</abbr> and <abbr title="Risk Margin">RM</abbr> together are called Technical Provisions (TP).</p>

<section>
  <h2>Solvency Capital Requirement</h2>

  <p>The last element on the liabilities side is <abbr title="Solvency Capital Requirement">SCR<abbr>.</p>

  <p>With Technical Provisions, we have covered liabilities that will most probably happen. But that's not enough, especially for our regulators.
    They want insurance companies to be secure. So secure so that insurance companies can cover their liabilities with 99.5% probability.</p>

  <p>Only in a 1-in-200 event, the assets can be lower than the liabilities.</p>
