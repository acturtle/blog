<p>I was recently discussing with a colleague if R is a useful programming language for actuarial reporting. We have found both: pros and cons. Below is our list.</p>

<h2>What are R’s strengths in actuarial reporting?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>R doesn’t allow for sweeping stuff under the rug.</strong>
  In Excel, you can easily have one formula for all rows except this one row where you had to change something by hand. R is more strict and all manual adjustments are obvious.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>R requires tables to be tables.</strong> In Excel, you can have some text in first rows, then a header, then maybe another and finally some values. In R, tables must be tables.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>R allows for proper version control.</strong>
  R is a code so can be used along with version control tools such as git.
  Using a version control tool means
  the knowledge what changes were made in each version, who made these changes
  and the possibility to revert to previous versions of the model.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>R makes data wrangling easy.</strong>
  I remember struggling to pivot longer a table in Excel.
  Thanks to many great packages, data manipulation in R is easy and elegant.
  New packages get developed every day thanks to the vibrant R community.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>R supports reproducible and effective communication.</strong>
  With Rmarkdown, the production of financial reports can be easily automated.
  With ggplot2 and Shiny apps the results can be effectively passed on
  to a wider audience.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What are R’s weaknesses in the actuarial reporting?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>R is not as popular as Excel.</strong>
  Many people know how to use Excel.
  Excel is used by actuaries as well as other professionals
  such as financial analysts and accountants.
  R is not as popular as Excel so requires additional training for employees.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>R is not a commercial product.</strong>
  Excel’s commercial character indicates the accountability of the creators
  for how it operates. R is open-source.
  Packages are created by individuals for you to use.
  However, you can not blame them if something goes wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I see a great potential of using R in the actuarial reporting.
I hope that more and more insurance companies will use R in the future!</p>
