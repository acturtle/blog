  <p>IFRS 17 has introduced the concept of fulfilment cash flows. Fulfilment cash flows are the building blocks of the general model.</p>

  <p>Fulfilment cash flows consist of inflows and outflows, discounting and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk. What remains after this calculation (if anything) is the CSM.</p>

  <p>Let's take a close look at each component of the fulfilment cash flows.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Future cash flows</h2>

  <p>Future cash flows can be split into <strong>inflows</strong> and <strong>outflows</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Inflows</strong> are mainly premiums within contract boundary.</p>

  <p><strong>Outflows</strong> consist of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>insurance acquisition costs,</li>
    <li>administration expenses,</li>
    <li>claims and benefit payments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Future cash flows are discounted to calculate their present value.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Discounting</h2>

  <p>Discount rates should reflect the time value of money and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.</p>

  <p>Discount rates should be consistent with the prices that we see in the market and with other financial assumptions.</p>

  <p>In IFRS 17, two approaches can be used for calculating the discount rates:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>bottom-up approach,</li>
    <li>top-down approach.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The two approaches might lead to slightly different discount rates.</p>

  <h3>Bottom-up approach</h3>

  <p>In the bottom-up approach, we start with the risk-free rates and add an illiquidity premium.</p>

  <div class="vertical-center">
    <img src="/static/img/bottom-up-approach.png" alt="Risk free rate plus illiquidity premium.">
  </div>

  <h3>Top-down approach</h3>

  <p>In top-down approach, we start with the yield based on actual assets held or reference portfolio. We then subtract two elements:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>market risk premium for <b>expected</b> credit losses,</li>
      <li>market risk premium for <b>unexpected</b> credit losses.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="vertical-center">
    <img src="/static/img/top-down-approach.png" alt="Yield on actual assets held or reference portfolio less market risk premiums.">
  </div>

  <p>Results of the bottom-up and top-down approaches should be close to each other. They don't have to be the same.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Risk adjustment for non-financial risk</h2>

  <p>Risk adjustment for non-financial risk is the amount the insurer charges for bearing the uncertainty over the amount and timing of cash flows arising from non-financial risk. Non-financial risks are for example insurance, expense or lapse risk.</p>

  <p>Standard does not prescribe any particular methodology to calculate risk adjustment. Derivation involves management judgement. Various methods can be used to calculate it.</p>

  <p>Factors that impact risk adjustment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>frequency and severity of risk,</li>
    <li>contract length,</li>
    <li>probability distribution,</li>
    <li>claims experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contractual Service Margin</h2>

  The <abbr title="Contractual Service Margin">CSM</abbr> is what remains after the other elements have been calculated.
