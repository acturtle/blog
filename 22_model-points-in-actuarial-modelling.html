  <p>In short, a model point is a policy record used for the actuarial cash flow models.</p>

  <p>Actuarial cash flow models have two main types of inputs: assumptions and policy data. Assumptions include mortality rates, lapse rates and interest rates. Policy data contain information on policyholders (age, sum insured, fund value etc.).</p>

  <p>The company might have many policies in its portfolio. Some policies are very similar and have the same attributes. Actuaries can store them into one data record. The number of policies amounts to two for this model point. Instead of calculating the actuarial model twice, we only need to calculate it once.</p>

  <h2>Technology development</h2>

  <p>The technology improves fast. The aggregation of many policies into one record might not be necessary anymore. The models get faster and faster thanks to better computers. Nowadays - usually - one model point reflects one policy.</p>

  <p>Per policy structure of model points is sometimes necessary. For example when actuaries need detailed results.</p>

  <h2>Model points structure</h2>

  <p>There are various ways actuaries can structure model points.</p>

  <p>In particular, policy data can be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>held in one or multiple <b>files</b>,</li>
    <li>held in one or multiple <b>records</b>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It's a good practice to have a unique identifier for each policy in data. If you don't have it, you can use a record number.</p>

  <p>In the case of multiple files, there are <b>a primary file</b> and <b>secondary files</b>. The primary file contains the main policy data. Secondary files contain other attributes (such as funds or coverages).</p>

  <p>We can distinguish the following types of policy data structures:</p>
  <ol>
      <li><b>One file, one record</b> - data in one file, each policy has one record.</li>
      <li><b>One file, multiple records</b> - data in one file, a policy can have multiple records.</li>
      <li><b>Multiple files, one record </b> - data in multiple files, there is one record per policy in primary file as well as in secondary files.</li>
      <li><b>Multiple files, one record in primary file and multiple records in secondary files</b> - data in multiple files, there is one record per policy in primary file and multiple in secondary files.</li>
      <li><b>Multiple files, multiple records</b> - data in multiple files, there are multiple records in primary file as well as in secondary files.</li>
  </ol>

<div class="vertical-center">
  <table class="striped-table" style="width: auto;">
    <tr>
      <th>case</th>
      <th>primary</th>
      <th>secondary</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>=1</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>≥1</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>=1</td>
      <td>=1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>=1</td>
      <td>≥1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>≥1</td>
      <td>≥1</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Let's consider each of these types.</p>

  <h3>1. One file, one record</h3>

  <div class="vertical-center"><img src="/static/img/22/mp-1.png" width="262" height="239"></div>

  <p>That's the easiest structure of model points. There is only one file and each record corresponds to one policy.</p>
  <p>The actuarial cash flow model loops over all policies and calculates the results for each of them. The output concatenates or aggregates the per policy output.</p>


  <h3>2. One file, multiple records</h3>

  <div class="vertical-center"><img src="/static/img/22/mp-2.png" width="262" height="307"></div>

  <p>In some cases, actuaries store data for the same policy in multiple records.</p>
  <p>For example, a policy has two insured persons and each of them appears in a separate row.</p>

  <h3>3. Multiple files, one record</h3>

  <div class="vertical-center"><img src="/static/img/22/mp-3.png" width="475" height="239"></div>

  <p>It might be easier to produce multiple files for model points. Multiple files are split into the primary file and secondary files. The primary file contains the main policy data. Secondary files contain - for example - fund data.</p>
  <p>The cause of separate files might be separate administration systems.</p>
  <p>The secondary files may have fewer records than the primary file. This happens when, for example, the policyholder doesn't hold any fund.</p>


  <h3>4. Multiple files, one record in primary file and multiple records in secondary files</h3>

  <div class="vertical-center"><img src="/static/img/22/mp-4.png" width="475" height="341"></div>

  <p>As above, files are split into the primary file and secondary files. Here, secondary files store one or more records per policy.</p>
  <p>We use it when the policyholder holds multiple funds or the policy has multiple coverages. Since one policyholder might have 2 funds and the other 3 funds, the wide-format of data is not recommended. The long format is more flexible.</p>
  <p>The model should split the calculation between primary and secondary policy data. For example, if the policy has 3 funds, the model performs calculations for each fund. The main policy calculation retrieves values for each of the funds.</p>


  <h3>5. Multiple files, multiple records</h3>

  <div class="vertical-center"><img src="/static/img/22/mp-5.png" width="475" height="341"></div>

  <p>In this structure, there are multiple files and in each multiple records.</p>

  <p>This structure is confusing. It is not clear if data from secondary files links to all records from the primary file or only one. We recommend transforming the primary file into a wide format and keeping one record per policy.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>Usually, there are one or two (married couple with pension) insured persons per policy. Keeping one record per policy in the primary file (in a wide format) should not be problematic.</p>

  <p>Also, keeping data in multiple files should have a purpose. This approach is necessary when we have a variable number of e.g. funds or coverages.</p>

  <p>Having that in mind, these are the recommended model point structures:</p>
  <ol>
      <li style="color: darkgreen;"><b>One file, one record</b> - OK!</li>
      <li style="color: darkred;"><b>One file, multiple records</b> - transform to wide format and/or separate data with various number of points.</li>
      <li style="color: darkred;"><b>Multiple files, one record</b> - join tables and keep one file.</li>
      <li style="color: darkgreen;"><b>Multiple files, one record in primary file and multiple records in secondary files</b> - OK!</li>
      <li style="color: darkred;"><b>Multiple files, multiple records</b> - prone to errors, transform primary file to wide format.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In my view, the clearest structure is when there is one primary file where each record reflects one policy. If needed, there are secondary files with one or more records.</p>
