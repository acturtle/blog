  <p>A positive CSM is released to the income statement over the coverage period.</p>

  <p>What about groups of insurance contracts that are <strong>onerous</strong>, and therefore expected to be loss-making?</p>

  <p>In this post, we will consider three cases:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Contracts with reduced CSM</li>
    <li>Initially onerous contracts</li>
    <li>Contracts that become onerous</li>
  </ol>
 </section>

  <h2>Contracts with reduced CSM</h2>

  <p>The group of contracts might have a positive CSM at inception. It means that the insurer expected to make a profit on them.</p>

  <p>
    Over time, there might be changes in non-financial assumptions. 
    Let's assume that changes in non-financial assumptions have a negative impact on the CSM, but it remains positive.
    The insurer still expects a profit, but it will be lower than initially hoped for.
  </p>

  <p>In that situation, we should adjust the CSM to take into account the reduced profitability.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Initially onerous contracts</h2>

  <p>
    There might be groups of contracts where the insurer expects to make a loss from the beginning. 
    For example, the insurer launches a new product and prices it to gain market share from a competitor.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the group of contracts is onerous at inception, IFRS 17 requires these contracts to be allocated to a separate group 
    that does not include contracts with a positive CSM.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this group of contracts, no CSM is established. 
    Instead, the initial measurement of the net fulfilment cash flows is recognised as a loss in the statement of profit or loss.

<section>
  <h2>Contracts that become onerous</h2>

  <p>
    Some groups of contracts can become onerous after inception.
    This can be due to a material negative impact from changes in non-financial assumptions.
  </p>

  <p>In this case, the excess amount is immediately recognised in the income statement.</p>

  <p>
    Once a group of contracts becomes onerous, all subsequent positive changes in non-financial assumptions are booked in the income statement 
    as a reversal of previously recognised losses.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the impact of a positive change in assumptions is larger than the cumulative loss booked in the income statement, 
    the excess is used to re-establish a CSM.
