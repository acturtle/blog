  In this blog post, I'll share the concept behind <strong>CashflowerHub</strong>,
  an application designed to be a central place for actuarial models, runs, and documentation.
  Currently, CashflowerHub is in its early development stages,
  with the core features being outlined.
</p>

<p>CashflowerHub combines three key elements needed for effective actuarial reporting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cashflow models,</li>
  <li>runs,</li>
  <li>documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The idea is to bring these parts together in one place, saving time and making things easier to manage.
</p>


<h2>Models</h2>

<p>
  The "Models" page lists all the cashflow models owned by a company.
  Users can add, edit, and delete models as needed.
</p>

<div class="vertical-center">
  <img src="\static\img\115\models.jpg" width="1200" height="642" alt="Print screen of the 'Models' page.">
</div>

<p>When viewing a specific model, users will find all the essential details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>model name,</li>
  <li>model ID,</li>
  <li>repository URL,</li>
  <li>description,</li>
  <li>created at and by,</li>
  <li>last updated at and by.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to keep model management simple and clear.</p>


<h2>Runs</h2>

<p>
  The "Runs" page lists all the model runs.
  Users can easily create new runs, which are then sent to the cloud for execution.
</p>

<div class="vertical-center">
  <img src="\static\img\115\runs.jpg" width="1200" height="642" alt="Print screen of the 'Runs' page.">
</div>

<p>Each run contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>run ID,</li>
  <li>associated model,</li>
  <li>version(s),</li>
  <li>status (completed, running, pending, error),</li>
  <li>created at and by,</li>
  <li>log from the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps keep track of all model runs and their progress.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
  The "Documentation" page stores all documents related to actuarial processes.
  This allows for centralized storage and easy access to all relevant documentation.
</p>

<div class="vertical-center">
  <img src="\static\img\115\documentation.jpg" width="1200" height="642" alt="Print screen of the 'Documentation' page.">
</div>

<p>Each document includes details such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>document ID,</li>
  <li>file,</li>
  <li>linked model(s),</li>
  <li>created at and by,</li>
  <li>last updated at and by.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
  <strong>CashflowerHub</strong> is in its early stages, but there is a lot of room for growth.
  Right now, I’m setting up the basics, but there’s definitely potential to develop it
  into something that can help actuarial teams or businesses that work with cashflow models.
</p>

<p>
  I'm excited about what CashflowerHub can do, and with some added resources,
  it could reach its full potential.
