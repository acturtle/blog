<p>In the world of actuarial science, we frequently encounter optimization problems.
These challenges are most prevalent in the realm of pricing, where our goal is often to achieve a specific objective,
such as expected profit. In this post, we will dive into a simple actuarial optimization problem
and demonstrate how to solve it using two tools: Excel's Solver and Python.</p>

  <h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

  <p>Let's consider a 3-year term policy with a net premium of €100.
    We aim to find a profit margin that yields a present value of premiums equal to €3000, assuming a discount factor of 0.98.</p>

  <p>In Excel's Solver, we would follow these steps:</p>

  <p>1. Setting up the problem:</p>

  <div class="horizontal-center">
    <img src="/static/img/blog/045/solver_1.webp" alt="Excel Solver tool with the objective to set present values of premiums to 3000" width="960" height="1160">
  </div>

  <p>2. Solution found:</p>


  <div class="horizontal-center">
    <img src="/static/img/blog/045/solver_2.webp" alt="Excel Solver tool displaying a found solution" width="960" height="1160">
  </div>

  <p>The profit margin that meets the criteria is 13.97%.</p>

<h2 id="excel">Python solution</h2>

<p>In Python, we can achieve the same result using the <span class="inline-code">scipy</span> package.
  Here's the equivalent solution:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from scipy.optimize import root


DISCOUNT_FACTOR = 0.98


def premium(profit_margin):
    return 100 * (1 + profit_margin)


def pv_premium(t, profit_margin):
    if t == 36:
        return premium(profit_margin)
    return premium(profit_margin) + pv_premium(t+1, profit_margin) * DISCOUNT_FACTOR


def eqn(profit_margin):
    return pv_premium(0, profit_margin) - 3_000


myroot = root(eqn, 0)
print(myroot.x)  # Output: [0.13970692]
</code></pre>

<p>This Python code, which uses the <span class="inline-code">scipy</span> package, gives us the same answer as Excel.
It calculates a profit margin of 13.97%.</p>

<p><b>Understanding the code:</b></p>
<p>Here's a simple explanation of the Python code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We set the discount factor to <span class="inline-code">0.98</span>.</li>
  <li>The <span class="inline-code">premium()</span> function calculates the premium with the given profit margin.</li>
  <li><span class="inline-code">pv_premium()</span> calculates the total premium over time, considering the discount.</li>
  <li><span class="inline-code">eqn()</span> is the equation we want to solve.</li>
  <li><span class="inline-code">myroot</span> helps us find the answer, which is the desired profit margin.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, we looked at a common actuarial problem related to insurance pricing.
We solved it using both Excel's Solver and Python with the scipy package.
The consistent result of a 13.97% profit margin shows that actuarial tools
can be powerful and versatile in today's data-driven world.</p>
